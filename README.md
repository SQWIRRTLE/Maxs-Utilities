converts mp4s and most common image formats into a gif, can also delete files

be careful with file deletion on the program because it's not reversible  
all .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp and .mp4 files in the selected input folder will be converted into a .gif

you may need to move the shortcut into the correct place to use it on your home-screen

windows defender / other anti-malware things might flag it because its a .exe with an 'unknown publisher' (obviously its not a virus)

PROCEED WITH CAUTION!
